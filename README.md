## Problem Statement

Millions in rural and disaster-prone regions face unreliable electricity, impacting health, education, and economic growth. Traditional grids are fragile, easily disrupted by extreme weather or infrastructure challenges. Marginalized communities, remote villages, and essential services like clinics and schools are hit hardest—where power loss can have severe consequences. Without adaptable, resilient energy solutions, these populations remain trapped by energy insecurity, perpetuating poverty and limiting opportunity. Addressing this is crucial for equitable access to essential services, quality of life, and climate resilience.

## Solution Overview

**HelioSentinel** is a modular solar microgrid system enhanced with AI to ensure maximum reliability. It features solar panels, battery storage, and intelligent inverters, all coordinated by an AI-driven platform. Through real-time monitoring of production, consumption, and equipment health, HelioSentinel predicts failures, optimizes battery use, and automatically adjusts power distribution to maintain uptime—even during adverse conditions or grid outages. The system can operate independently or alongside the main grid and offers remote monitoring, automated alerts, and rapid fault response. It is scalable, easy to deploy, and designed for off-grid, rural, or disaster-affected areas, delivering clean, resilient power wherever needed.

## Current Status & Next Steps

HelioSentinel is at the advanced concept stage. We have completed architectural design, hardware selection, and a prototype AI monitoring platform using open-source tools. Next steps include:
- Building a functional microgrid prototype and integrating IoT sensors.
- Refining AI algorithms with simulated and real-world data.
- Setting up a test environment to validate predictive maintenance and energy optimization.
- Enhancing user dashboards for intuitive remote management.
- Gathering community input to tailor features to local needs.

This preparatory work will enable demonstration of a working, resilient microgrid before the main hackathon, providing a strong foundation for further development and deployment.
